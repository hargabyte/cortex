{"id":"cortex-1ex","title":"cx scan: Multi-language auto-detection only scans first detected language","description":"When running cx scan without --lang flag in a mixed-language project or a Kotlin/Ruby-only project, the scanner only processes the first detected language. Kotlin and Ruby files are skipped entirely even when they are the only source files.\n\n## Issues Found During Language Testing (January 2026)\n\n### Critical\n\n1. **Kotlin/Ruby Auto-detection Bypass**\n   - **Severity**: High\n   - **Symptom**: `cx scan` without `--lang` flag skips Kotlin/Ruby files\n   - **Root Cause**: Multi-language auto-detection only scans first detected language\n   - **Workaround**: Use `--lang kotlin` or `--lang ruby` explicitly\n   - **File**: internal/cmd/scan.go, lines 126-145\n\n### Major\n\n2. **Kotlin Requires --force Flag**\n   - **Severity**: Medium\n   - **Symptom**: Without `--force`, all Kotlin files skipped even with `--lang kotlin`\n   - **Workaround**: Always use `--force` for initial Kotlin scans\n\n3. **Rust Entity Persistence Bug**\n   - **Severity**: Medium\n   - **Symptom**: Complex Rust files with duplicate method names (e.g., multiple `new()` across impl blocks) don't persist entities\n   - **Observation**: Scan shows entities created, but `cx db info` shows 0 active entities; dependencies ARE persisted\n   - **Workaround**: Use simpler Rust files or rename duplicate methods\n\n### Minor\n\n4. **cx find --type/--lang Requires Query**\n   - `cx find --type F --lang go` errors without a query string\n   - Use `cx find --important --type F --lang go` instead\n\n5. **Tag add with ambiguous entity names fails**\n   - Requires disambiguation for entities with the same name\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n```bash\n# Kotlin auto-detection issue\ngit clone https://github.com/user/kotlin-project\ncx scan\n# Observe: 'Skipped: 112' - all Kotlin files skipped\n\n# Rust entity persistence issue\n# Create a Rust file with multiple impl blocks having duplicate method names\ncx scan --lang rust\ncx db info  # Shows 0 active entities\n```\n\n## Tested Languages (All PASS with noted caveats)\n\n| Language | Status |\n|----------|--------|\n| Go | PASS |\n| TypeScript | PASS |\n| JavaScript | PASS |\n| Java | PASS |\n| Rust | PASS (entity persistence issue with complex files) |\n| Python | PASS |\n| C | PASS |\n| C++ | PASS |\n| C# | PASS |\n| PHP | PASS |\n| Kotlin | PASS (requires --lang flag) |\n| Ruby | PASS (requires --lang flag) |","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T06:34:21.286183505Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-16T14:32:15.046176079Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T14:32:15.046176079Z","close_reason":"Fixed by iterating through all detected languages in scan.go instead of only scanning the first language.

{"id":"cortex-1he","title":"CX + Beads Deep Integration","description":"# CX + Beads Deep Integration\n\nTransform agent workflows by automatically enriching beads with Cortex intelligence.\n\n## Vision\n\nWhen a task is created, it automatically includes:\n- Entry points for the work\n- Affected keystones and blast radius\n- Relevant entities with locations\n- Suggested tests\n- File recommendations\n\nAgents picking up tasks get immediate, focused context - no exploration phase needed.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. CX-Smart Task Creation\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Add rate limiting to API\" --cx-smart \"rate limiting API\"\n```\n\nCreates a bead with embedded context:\n\n```yaml\ntitle: Add rate limiting to API\ntype: task\npriority: 2\n\ncx_context:\n  generated_at: 2026-01-15T10:30:00Z\n  query: \"rate limiting API\"\n  \n  entry_points:\n    - name: HandleRequest\n      location: internal/api/handler.go:45-89\n      type: function\n      relevance: high\n      \n    - name: Middleware\n      location: internal/middleware/chain.go:23-45\n      type: function\n      relevance: high\n      \n  keystones_at_risk:\n    - name: AuthMiddleware\n      location: internal/middleware/auth.go:12-67\n      pagerank: 0.015\n      coverage: 78%\n      \n  impact_summary:\n    files_affected: 8\n    entities_affected: 23\n    risk_level: medium\n    \n  suggested_files:\n    - internal/api/handler.go\n    - internal/middleware/chain.go\n    \n  suggested_tests:\n    existing:\n      - TestAPIHandler\n      - TestMiddlewareChain\n    needed:\n      - TestRateLimiting (new functionality)\n```\n\n### 2. Bi-Directional Entity Linking\n\n```bash\n# Link entities to beads (manual or automatic)\ncx link bd-xxx HandleRequest\ncx link bd-xxx RateLimiter --reason \"implemented for this task\"\n\n# Query: what beads touch this entity?\ncx show HandleRequest --beads\n# Output: linked_beads: [bd-xxx \"Add rate limiting\", bd-yyy \"Fix auth bug\"]\n\n# Query: what entities are linked to this bead?\nbd show bd-xxx --cx-links\n# Output: linked_entities: [HandleRequest, RateLimiter, Middleware]\n\n# Auto-link on commit (via hook)\n# Parses commit message for bead ID, links touched entities\n```\n\n### 3. Task Decomposition from CX Analysis\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Refactor authentication\" --cx-smart \"auth\" --decompose\n```\n\nAutomatically creates subtasks based on affected keystones:\n\n```yaml\n# Parent task\ntitle: Refactor authentication\ntype: task\nchildren:\n  - bd-xxx-1: \"Update AuthMiddleware\" (keystone, 15 callers)\n  - bd-xxx-2: \"Update UserValidator\" (keystone, 8 callers)  \n  - bd-xxx-3: \"Update TokenService\" (5 callers)\n  - bd-xxx-4: \"Add/update tests for auth changes\"\n```\n\n### 4. Context Refresh on Task View\n\n```bash\nbd show bd-xxx --cx-refresh\n```\n\nRe-runs CX analysis to see if context has changed:\n\n```yaml\ncx_context_diff:\n  since: 2026-01-14T08:00:00Z\n  changes:\n    - HandleRequest: signature changed (callers may need update)\n    - NewEntity: RateLimiter added (not in original context)\n  recommendation: \"Context is stale - re-analyze before continuing\"\n```\n\n### 5. Agent Handoff Context\n\nWhen an agent picks up a task:\n\n```bash\nbd update bd-xxx --status in_progress --agent claude-polecat-1\n\n# Agent gets context packet:\ncx context --for-bead bd-xxx --budget 8000\n```\n\nOutput is optimized for immediate work:\n- Files to read first\n- Entities to understand\n- Dependencies to be aware of\n- Tests to run after changes\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Loose Coupling (Recommended)\n\nCX and Beads remain independent tools that communicate through:\n\n1. **Structured output**: `cx context --smart \"query\" --format json`\n2. **Import command**: `bd create --cx-context \u003cfile.json\u003e` or piped\n3. **Link storage**: Both tools store links, sync via their normal mechanisms\n\n**Why loose coupling:**\n- Each tool can evolve independently\n- No circular dependencies\n- Works even if one tool is missing\n- Easier to test and debug\n\n### Integration Points\n\n```bash\n# CX outputs, BD imports\ncx context --smart \"task\" --format json | bd create \"Title\" --cx-context -\n\n# BD queries CX\nbd show bd-xxx --cx-refresh  # Calls cx internally\n\n# Shared link storage\n# CX stores: entity_id -\u003e bead_id\n# BD stores: bead_id -\u003e entity_ids (in metadata)\n# Both sync via git\n```\n\n### Hook Integration\n\n```bash\n# .git/hooks/post-commit\n# Auto-link touched entities to bead mentioned in commit message\nBEAD_ID=$(git log -1 --format=%B | grep -oE 'bd-[a-z0-9]+')\nif [ -n \"$BEAD_ID\" ]; then\n  CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD)\n  for file in $CHANGED_FILES; do\n    cx link-file \"$BEAD_ID\" \"$file\" --auto\n  done\nfi\n```\n\n## GasTown Integration\n\nFor multi-agent coordination:\n\n### Task Assignment with Context\n\n```bash\n# Mayor creates task with full context\nbd create \"Add rate limiting\" --cx-smart \"rate limiting\" --type task\n\n# Sling to polecat - context travels with task\ngt sling bd-xxx cortex --agent polecat-claude\n# Polecat receives: task + cx_context + suggested_files\n```\n\n### Parallel Work Coordination\n\n```bash\n# CX tracks which files are being worked on\ncx claim bd-xxx internal/api/handler.go --agent polecat-1\ncx claim bd-yyy internal/middleware/auth.go --agent polecat-2\n\n# Agents can check before modifying\ncx status internal/api/handler.go\n# Output: claimed by polecat-1 for bd-xxx\n\n# Prevents merge conflicts by coordinating file access\n```\n\n### Post-Work Linking\n\n```bash\n# Polecat finishes work\nbd close bd-xxx --reason \"Added RateLimiter middleware\"\n\n# Auto-link what was actually changed\ncx link-commit bd-xxx HEAD --auto\n# Links all entities in the commit to the bead\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bd create --cx-smart` creates task with embedded CX context\n- [ ] `cx link \u003cbead\u003e \u003centity\u003e` creates bi-directional links\n- [ ] `cx show \u003centity\u003e --beads` shows linked beads\n- [ ] `bd show \u003cbead\u003e --cx-links` shows linked entities\n- [ ] Context includes: entry points, keystones, impact, suggested tests\n- [ ] `--decompose` auto-creates subtasks from keystone analysis\n- [ ] Links persist and sync with git\n- [ ] Works with GasTown sling workflow\n- [ ] Hooks auto-link on commit\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- cortex-b44: CX Live Mode (for freshness/daemon)\n- cortex-dsr: Smart Context Enhancements (for --diff context)\n- cortex-ali: Entity Tagging (for task: tag convention)\n- cortex-9dk: Test Intelligence (for suggested tests)\n\n## Notes\n\nThis integration transforms the agent workflow from:\n1. Pick up task\n2. Read description\n3. Explore codebase to find relevant code (many tool calls)\n4. Understand dependencies\n5. Start working\n\nTo:\n1. Pick up task\n2. Read embedded cx_context\n3. Start working (files already identified)\n\nEstimated context savings: 40-60% fewer exploration tool calls per task.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:31.953617213Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:31.953617213Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cortex-1he","depends_on_id":"cortex-b44","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:37.819215685Z","created_by":"hargabyte"},{"issue_id":"cortex-1he","depends_on_id":"cortex-dsr","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:38.085221161Z","created_by":"hargabyte"},{"issue_id":"cortex-1he","depends_on_id":"cortex-ali","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:38.325330375Z","created_by":"hargabyte"},{"issue_id":"cortex-1he","depends_on_id":"cortex-9dk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:51:38.58962115Z","created_by":"hargabyte"}]}

Update `internal/cache/cache.go`:\n   - Change import from `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` to `modernc.org/sqlite`\n   - Change `sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", ...)` to `sql.Open(\"sqlite\", ...)`\n2. Run `go mod tidy` to remove unused `mattn/go-sqlite3` dependency\n3. Run tests to verify nothing breaks\n\n### Phase 2: Create GitHub Actions Release Workflow\n1. Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` with:\n   - Trigger on version tags (v*)\n   - Build matrix:\n     - Linux amd64 (ubuntu-latest)\n     - Linux arm64 (ubuntu-latest with cross-compile)\n     - Windows amd64 (windows-latest) **[Priority]**\n     - macOS amd64 (macos-latest)\n     - macOS arm64 (macos-latest) **[Apple Silicon]**\n   - CGO_ENABLED=1 for all builds (required for tree-sitter)\n   - Strip debug symbols (-ldflags=\"-s -w\") for smaller binaries\n   - Upload artifacts to GitHub Release\n\n### Phase 3: Add Version Injection\n1. Add version variable to `cmd/cx/main.go`\n2. Inject version from git tag via `-ldflags=\"-X main.version=...\"`\n3. Add `cx version` command if not exists\n\n### Phase 4: Create Makefile for Local Development\n1. Add targets: build, build-windows, build-linux, build-darwin\n2. Add test, clean, release targets\n3. Document cross-compilation requirements for local builds\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Run existing test suite after SQLite consolidation\n- Test Windows binary in Windows environment (or VM/Wine)\n- Test macOS binary on Mac hardware if available\n\n## Success Criteria\n- `git tag v0.1.0 \u0026\u0026 git push --tags` triggers automated release\n- Windows .exe binary works on Windows 10/11\n- macOS binary works on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs\n- Linux binary continues to work as before","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T17:30:56.597981393Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:43.945803543Z","closed_at":"2026-01-16T18:54:43.945803543Z","close_reason":"Cross-platform release support complete.

Add --json-lines output mode for streaming\nFor large outputs (graph, context), streaming JSONL is more memory-efficient:\n\n```bash\ncx graph Entity --hops 3 --format jsonl\n# {\"type\":\"node\",\"data\":{\"name\":\"Entity\",...}}\n# {\"type\":\"node\",\"data\":{\"name\":\"Store\",...}}\n# {\"type\":\"edge\",\"data\":{\"from\":\"Entity\",\"to\":\"Store\"}}\n```\n\n## 3. Improve smart context keyword extraction\nCurrent: `cx context --smart \"add rate limiting\"` matched random comments\nImprovement: Weight keywords by:\n- Entity names (highest weight)\n- Parameter names\n- Type names\n- Comments (lowest weight)\n\nAlso consider domain detection:\n- \"rate limiting\" → look for HTTP, API, middleware patterns\n- \"database\" → look for SQL, query, connection patterns\n- \"auth\" → look for login, token, session patterns\n\n## 4. Add cx diff command\nCompare two scans to see what changed:\n\n```bash\ncx diff --since \"2 hours ago\"\n# added:\n#   - NewFunction (internal/cmd/new.go:10)\n# modified:\n#   - ExistingFunction (body changed)\n# removed:\n#   - OldFunction\n```\n\n## 5. Quiet mode for scripting\n```bash\ncx scan --quiet  # No output, just exit code\ncx verify --quiet  # Exit 0 if valid, 1 if drifted\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `internal/cmd/root.go` - Add status alias\n- `internal/output/formatter.go` - Add JSONL format\n- `internal/context/smart.go` - Improve keyword extraction\n- New: `internal/cmd/diff.go`\n- Various: Add --quiet flag\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] cx status works as alias\n- [ ] --format jsonl available\n- [ ] Smart context more relevant\n- [ ] cx diff shows changes since last scan\n- [ ] --quiet mode for scripting","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T14:31:36.088219048Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-15T15:47:16.691537017Z","closed_at":"2026-01-15T15:47:16.691537017Z","close_reason":"Implemented all 5 AI-optimized output improvements: (1) cx status alias for db info, (2) --quiet flag for scripting, (3) --format jsonl streaming output, (4) cx diff command showing changes since last scan, (5) improved smart context keyword extraction with identifier-vs-generic separation and name-only matching"}

{"id":"cortex-b44","title":"CX Live Mode \u0026 Daemon Infrastructure","description":"# CX Live Mode \u0026 Daemon Infrastructure\n\nEnable real-time, persistent Cortex operations through a transparent daemon that starts automatically and manages itself.\n\n## Core Design: Transparent Daemon\n\n**The daemon is an implementation detail - users never think about it.**\n\n```bash\n# User just runs normal commands\ncx context --smart \"auth\"\n\n# Under the hood:\n# 1. Check if daemon running → no\n# 2. Start daemon in background (invisible)\n# 3. Route query to daemon\n# 4. Return results\n# 5. Daemon stays alive, watching files\n# 6. 30 min idle → daemon exits silently\n\n# Next command 5 minutes later\ncx safe src/parser.go\n# Daemon still running → instant response, graph is fresh\n```\n\n### User Experience\n\n| Scenario | What User Sees |\n|----------|----------------|\n| First command of session | Normal response (maybe 1-2s slower for daemon startup) |\n| Subsequent commands | Fast response (daemon warm, graph fresh) |\n| After 30min idle | Next command auto-starts daemon again |\n| Daemon crashes | Commands still work (fallback to direct DB) |\n\n**Users never run `cx live` manually** - it's all automatic.\n\n## Core Goals\n\n1. **Auto-start daemon** - First cx command starts daemon if not running\n2. **Incremental scanning** - Daemon watches files, updates graph on save\n3. **Auto-shutdown** - Daemon exits after 30min idle (no user action needed)\n4. **Transparent fallback** - If daemon fails, commands work via direct DB access\n5. **Freshness tracking** - Always know if graph is current\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Daemon Lifecycle\n\n```go\n// Every cx command does this at start\nfunc ensureDaemon() (*DaemonClient, error) {\n    // Try to connect to existing daemon\n    client, err := connectToDaemon()\n    if err == nil {\n        return client, nil // Already running\n    }\n    \n    // Not running - start it in background\n    cmd := exec.Command(\"cx\", \"live\", \"--background\", \"--idle-timeout\", \"30m\")\n    cmd.Start() // Detach from parent process\n    \n    // Wait for it to be ready (poll socket)\n    for i := 0; i \u003c 50; i++ {\n        client, err = connectToDaemon()\n        if err == nil {\n            return client, nil\n        }\n        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)\n    }\n    \n    return nil, errors.New(\"daemon failed to start\")\n}\n```\n\n### Query Routing with Fallback\n\n```go\nfunc runQuery(query Query) (Result, error) {\n    client, err := ensureDaemon()\n    if err != nil {\n        // Fallback: direct DB access (slower, graph might be stale)\n        log.Debug(\"daemon unavailable, using direct mode\")\n        return runQueryDirect(query)\n    }\n    return client.Query(query)\n}\n```\n\n### Daemon Responsibilities\n\n| Task | Implementation |\n|------|----------------|\n| Keep graph fresh | fsnotify watches source files, triggers incremental scan |\n| Answer queries | Unix socket or localhost port, receives serialized queries |\n| Track idle time | Reset 30min timer on any query or file change |\n| Clean shutdown | Timer expires → save state → exit(0) |\n\n### Incremental Scan Algorithm\n\nWhen daemon detects file change:\n1. Parse changed file with tree-sitter\n2. Compare new entities with indexed entities\n3. For removed entities: delete from DB, clean up dependencies\n4. For added entities: insert to DB\n5. For modified entities: update in place\n6. Recalculate metrics for affected subgraph only (not full PageRank)\n\n### Idle Timeout Logic\n\n```go\ntype Daemon struct {\n    idleTimer    *time.Timer\n    idleTimeout  time.Duration  // default 30m\n}\n\nfunc (d *Daemon) resetIdleTimer() {\n    d.idleTimer.Reset(d.idleTimeout)\n}\n\nfunc (d *Daemon) onQuery(q Query) Result {\n    d.resetIdleTimer()  // Activity detected\n    return d.processQuery(q)\n}\n\nfunc (d *Daemon) onFileChange(path string) {\n    d.resetIdleTimer()  // Activity detected\n    d.incrementalScan(path)\n}\n\nfunc (d *Daemon) onIdleTimeout() {\n    log.Info(\"idle timeout reached, shutting down\")\n    d.cleanup()\n    os.Exit(0)\n}\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n### Automatic (No User Action)\n\nMost users never need these - daemon is invisible:\n\n```bash\ncx find NewParser        # Auto-starts daemon if needed\ncx context --smart \"x\"   # Uses running daemon\ncx safe file.go          # Graph is always fresh\n```\n\n### Status (Informational)\n\n```bash\ncx status\n# Output:\n# Daemon: running (pid 12345, idle 5m, auto-shutdown in 25m)\n# Last file change: 2 minutes ago\n# Graph: fresh (0 stale files)\n# Entities: 1039 active\n\n# Or if not running:\n# Daemon: not running (will auto-start on next command)\n# Last scan: 2 hours ago  \n# Graph: stale (12 files changed since scan)\n```\n\n### Manual Control (Rarely Needed)\n\n```bash\ncx daemon stop           # Force stop daemon\ncx daemon restart        # Restart daemon\ncx daemon status         # Detailed daemon info\n```\n\n### Explicit Live Mode (For MCP/IDE Integration)\n\n```bash\ncx live                  # Start in foreground (for MCP server mode)\ncx live --mcp            # MCP protocol mode (for Claude Code integration)\ncx live --port 8080      # HTTP mode (for IDE extensions)\n```\n\n## Incremental Scan Details\n\n### File Change Detection\n\n```bash\ncx scan --incremental     # Manual: scan only changed files\n```\n\nBut normally daemon handles this automatically via fsnotify.\n\n### What Gets Tracked\n\n```sql\n-- File index tracks modification times\nCREATE TABLE file_index (\n    path TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    last_scanned TIMESTAMP,\n    last_modified TIMESTAMP,  -- from filesystem\n    content_hash TEXT\n);\n```\n\n### Freshness Check (For Agents)\n\n```bash\ncx status --json\n# {\n#   \"daemon_running\": true,\n#   \"daemon_pid\": 12345,\n#   \"daemon_idle_seconds\": 300,\n#   \"daemon_shutdown_in_seconds\": 1500,\n#   \"last_scan\": \"2026-01-15T10:23:45Z\",\n#   \"stale_files\": 0,\n#   \"graph_fresh\": true\n# }\n```\n\nAgents can use this to decide if they trust the graph:\n- `graph_fresh: true` → proceed with confidence\n- `graph_fresh: false` + daemon running → wait a moment, daemon is catching up\n- `graph_fresh: false` + daemon not running → first command will start it and scan\n\n## Communication Protocol\n\n### Unix Socket (Default)\n\n```\n~/.cx/daemon.sock\n```\n\nSimple request-response over Unix socket. Fast, local only.\n\n### HTTP (Optional, for IDE Integration)\n\n```bash\ncx live --port 8080\n# Listens on localhost:8080\n# REST API for IDE extensions\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] First `cx` command auto-starts daemon in background\n- [ ] Daemon watches filesystem and incrementally scans on file changes\n- [ ] Daemon shuts down after 30min idle (configurable)\n- [ ] All cx commands work with or without daemon (fallback mode)\n- [ ] `cx status` shows daemon state and graph freshness\n- [ ] `cx live` works for explicit MCP/HTTP server mode\n- [ ] Incremental scan correctly updates entities and dependencies\n- [ ] No user action required for normal operation\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn `.cx/config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\ndaemon:\n  idle_timeout: 30m        # Auto-shutdown after idle period\n  watch_paths:             # Directories to watch (default: project root)\n    - src/\n    - internal/\n  exclude_patterns:        # Don't trigger scan for these\n    - \"*.test.go\"\n    - \"node_modules/*\"\n```\n\n## Future: GasTown Integration\n\nThe daemon provides foundation for multi-agent coordination:\n- Multiple agents query same daemon\n- Daemon tracks file claims/locks\n- Agents see consistent graph state\n\n(Details in cortex-1he: CX + Beads Deep Integration)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:50:47.569589523Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-15T23:43:50.845373041Z"}

{"id":"cortex-dsr","title":"CX Smart Context Enhancements","description":"# CX Smart Context Enhancements\n\nImprove context assembly to be more relevant, especially for in-progress work.\n\n## Core Features\n\n### 1. Diff-Based Context\n```bash\ncx context --diff          # Context for uncommitted changes\ncx context --staged        # Context for staged changes only\ncx context --diff HEAD~3   # Context for last 3 commits\n```\n\n**Why:** When mid-implementation, the changed files ARE the task. No need to describe it in natural language.\n\n**Output:**\n```yaml\ndiff_context:\n  changed_files: 3\n  entities_modified:\n    - NewParser (signature changed)\n    - ParseFile (body modified)\n  entities_added:\n    - ParseOptions (new struct)\n  callers_affected:\n    - runScan (calls NewParser)\n    - detectDrift (calls ParseFile)\n  suggested_review:\n    - \"NewParser signature change affects 5 callers\"\n```\n\n### 2. Inline Drift Detection\n```bash\ncx safe src/parser.go --inline\n```\n\nCompares current file content against indexed state:\n```yaml\ndrift_detected:\n  - entity: NewParser\n    change: signature_changed\n    old: \"(lang: Language) -\u003e (*Parser, error)\"\n    new: \"(lang: Language, opts: Options) -\u003e (*Parser, error)\"\n    callers_to_update: 5\n```\n\n**Why:** `cx safe` currently shows blast radius for the indexed version. But if I've already modified the file, I want to know \"what did I break?\"\n\n### 3. Call Chain Tracer\n```bash\ncx trace HandleRequest SaveUser\n# Shows path: HandleRequest -\u003e UserService.Create -\u003e repo.SaveUser\n\ncx trace --all HandleRequest \"database\"\n# Shows all paths from HandleRequest to anything database-related\n```\n\n**Why:** Understanding data flow is a common need. The graph has this info but it's not directly queryable.\n\n### 4. Improved Smart Context Keywords\n```bash\ncx context --smart \"rate limiting API\" --budget 8000\n```\n\nImprovements:\n- Better keyword extraction (use 2-4 focused keywords)\n- Boost entities that are tagged (see tagging epic)\n- Include test files that cover entry points\n- Show \"why\" each entity was included\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Diff Context Implementation\n1. Get changed files from git (or filesystem comparison)\n2. For each file, compare current AST with indexed entities\n3. Identify: added, removed, modified entities\n4. Trace callers/callees of modified entities\n5. Assemble context focused on the delta\n\n### Drift Detection\n1. Parse current file content (don't save to DB)\n2. Compare entity signatures with indexed versions\n3. Report differences with actionable guidance\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `cx context --diff` shows context for uncommitted changes\n- [ ] `cx context --staged` shows context for staged changes\n- [ ] `cx safe --inline` detects drift from current file state\n- [ ] `cx trace A B` finds call paths between entities\n- [ ] Smart context includes \"why included\" reasoning","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T22:50:47.964280021Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-15T22:50:47.964280021Z"}

When it fails, agents fall back to manual exploration, wasting tokens and time.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Search Strategy: OR with Ranking (Primary Fix)\n\nChange from AND to OR, then rank by match quality:\n- Entities matching more keywords rank higher\n- But don't require ALL keywords to match\n\n### 2. Semantic Stopwords for Code Search\n\nFilter out generic terms that add noise:\n```go\ncodeStopWords := map[string]bool{\n    \"code\": true, \"source\": true, \"file\": true,\n    \"function\": true, \"method\": true, \"class\": true,\n    \"implement\": true, \"feature\": true,\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Keyword Weighting\n\nWeight by specificity:\n- Identifier-like (\"LoginHandler\", \"parse_result\") → high weight (2.0x)\n- Domain terms (\"parsing\", \"auth\", \"validation\") → medium weight (1.0x)\n- Generic terms (\"source\", \"code\", \"new\") → low weight (0.3x) or exclude\n\n### 4. Fallback Strategy\n\nIf combined search returns \u003c 3 results:\n1. Search each keyword individually\n2. Merge and dedupe results\n3. Rank by aggregate score\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `internal/store/fts.go` - `buildFTSQuery()`, `SearchEntities()`\n- `internal/context/smart.go` - `findEntryPoints()`, keyword extraction\n- `internal/context/smart_test.go` - Add multi-word query tests\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- `cx context --smart \"parsing source code\"` finds Parse, Parser, ParseResult\n- `cx context --smart \"add rate limiting to API\"` finds relevant rate/limit entities\n- Single keyword searches still work as before\n- No regression in search performance","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"hargabyte@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T19:24:25.657834823Z","created_by":"hargabyte","updated_at":"2026-01-15T19:40:48.757612783Z","closed_at":"2026-01-15T19:40:48.757612783Z","close_reason":"Fixed multi-word FTS5 search by: (1) Changing from AND to OR semantics for multi-word queries in buildFTSQuery(), (2) Adding code-specific stopwords (code, source, file, etc.) that add noise, (3) Adding fallback in findEntryPoints() to search individual keywords when combined search returns \u003c3 results.

'safe' is an adjective.\n\n2. **Auto-detect in `find`**: Single-word = name search, phrase = concept search. Shifts burden from agent to tool.\n\n3. **`--related` not `--around`**: More precise semantic term for graph topology.\n\n4. **`coverage` folds into `test`**: Coverage is a property of testing, not a standalone concern.\n\n5. **`prime` becomes `context` with no args**: Session recovery is just context assembly.\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n1.

Value Assessment\n- How often do users search by concept vs exact name?\n- What queries fail with current FTS that would work with semantic search?\n- Is this solving a real problem or a nice-to-have?\n\n### 2. Technical Approaches\n\n**Option A: Local Embeddings**\n- Use a small local model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n- Store embeddings in SQLite (as BLOBs or separate table)\n- Pros: Fast, offline, private\n- Cons: Model size, embedding quality\n\n**Option B: API-Based Embeddings**\n- Use OpenAI/Anthropic/Voyage embeddings API\n- Pros: High quality, no local model\n- Cons: Cost, latency, requires API key\n\n**Option C: Hybrid**\n- Use local for initial ranking\n- Optional API refinement for better results\n\n### 3.
